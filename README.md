# 👋 Hi there, I'm Anthony Backström

I'm a final-year ICT engineering student at **Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences**, specializing in **data analytics** and **artificial intelligence**. My studies are nearly complete — just the **thesis** and **final internship** remain.

Before stepping into tech, I spent 8 years working in **precision manufacturing** as a CNC machinist, operating Fanuc and Siemens systems. That hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for efficiency, accuracy, and solving practical problems — things I now approach from a data and automation perspective.

I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can turn data into decisions, and code into real-world impact.

## ⚡ Quick Facts

- 🧠 Strong analytical mindset — I thrive on solving real-world problems with code and data
- 📊 I use **Excel** for everything: tracking maintenance, planning meals, budgeting, scheduling... seriously, everything
- 🤖 I build things with **Raspberry Pi** — automation, sensors, logging, and small-scale IoT
- 🎲 I love **board games** and **miniature painting** — creativity and strategy keep me sharp
- 🧩 I enjoy planning workflows, routines, and complex tasks just for fun
