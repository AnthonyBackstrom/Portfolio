# üëã Hi there, I'm Anthony Backstr√∂m

I'm a final-year ICT engineering student at **Jyv√§skyl√§ University of Applied Sciences**, specializing in **data analytics** and **artificial intelligence**. My studies are nearly complete ‚Äî just the **thesis** and **final internship** remain.

Before stepping into tech, I spent 8 years working in **precision manufacturing** as a CNC machinist, operating Fanuc, AutoCAD and Siemens systems. That hands-on experience gave me a deep appreciation for efficiency, accuracy, and solving practical problems ‚Äî things I now approach from a data and automation perspective.

I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can turn data into decisions, and code into real-world impact.



## ‚ö° Quick Facts

- üß† I'm part data wrangler, part automation nerd, part board game strategist
- üìä I use **Excel** for everything: tracking maintenance, planning meals, budgeting, scheduling... seriously, everything
- ü§ñ I build things with **Raspberry Pi** ‚Äî automation, sensors, logging, and random Raspberry Pi contraptions "just because"
- üé≤ I love **board games** and **miniature painting** ‚Äî creativity and strategy keep me sharp
- üß© I believe every problem is either a logic puzzle or a spreadsheet waiting to happen


# üìÇ Projects

## üß™ [FAST-TEST ‚Äì Smartphone LFA Strip Reader 2025(ongoing)]() *(Prototype)*

**FAST-TEST** is a Python-based desktop prototype that transforms a smartphone into a compact reader for hormone-sensitive **lateral flow test strips (LFA)** ‚Äî starting with salivary cortisol and testosterone. The application detects 0‚Äì4 visible lines in the test area from a photo and maps them to estimated hormone levels. Results are visualized on a time-series curve and saved for trend tracking.

This project is developed **in collaboration with a friend** during our free time, with expert data support and validation from **two medical companies** involved in hormone diagnostics. They are responsible for providing test materials and reference data.

This solution is designed as a **research-grade prototype** and is **not for medical use**.

**My responsibilities in the project:**
- Independently developed the full prototype in Python & JupyterLab  
- Designed and implemented the image processing pipeline using **OpenCV**  
- Developed the calibration workflow and thresholding logic  
- Built the reporting layer (graph output, text feedback, data logging)  
- Maintained the repository and organized the entire codebase  
- Designed the project structure and technical documentation  

üìå Due to ongoing development, only planning documents are public for now. Source demo code and demo datasets will be shared after final review.

> üîí *Prototype phase only ‚Äì not validated for clinical use.*



## üöó [AIDA - Car Price Predictor 2024](./aida-team1/6-deployment/report/end_report.ipynb)  
As part of a data analytics and machine learning project at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, our four‚Äëperson team developed a machine learning model that analyzes data from over **3 million used cars**.  
The resulting application provides accurate price estimates for future vehicles to support **car dealership needs**, enabling:
- Data-driven pricing decisions  
- Improved customer experience  
- Optimized inventory management  

**My role in the project** focused on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing large-scale automotive datasets  [Data description report](./aida-team1/2-data-understanding/data-description-report.ipynb) 
- Exploring and analyzing the raw automotive data to uncover trends and relevant features [Data Preparation Report](./aida-team1/3-data-preparation/data-preparation-report.ipynb) , ["What kind of cars sell the worst?"](./aida-team1/3-data-preparation/worst_cars.ipynb) 
- Training and tuning the machine learning model  [Creation, training, and analyzation of Light Gradient Boosted Machine -model](./aida-team1/4-modeling/lightgbm_model.ipynb) 
- Integrating the trained model into our application  
- Testing the application functionality and validating model outputs




## üì• [Skillpicker ‚Äì Future Skills Mapping Tool 2023](./x-backend/README.md)

As part of the **Future Factory course** at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, our team *Code Crusaders* was assigned to design and develop an application called **Skillpicker**.  
The goal of the project is to bridge the gap between education and industry by collecting information on future skill needs from businesses and providing it to educational institutions. This helps schools update curricula to match real-world demands ‚Äî improving employability and reducing the skill mismatch.

Our solution features:
- A responsive web application where businesses can submit skill data (based on the SFIA framework)  
- A database-driven backend for storing and managing the input  
- A clean and user-friendly interface for easy interaction and data submission

**My role in the project** focused on frontend development. I was responsible for:
- Designing and building the **official website** and web interface for the Skill Collector service  
- Creating the questionnaire form for businesses to input data  
- Implementing responsive design and accessibility features  
- Collaborating with the backend team to ensure smooth data flow and integration  
- Developed and maintained a built-in feedback feature, enabling users to report issues and suggest improvements; supported continuous refinement based on real user input
- Participating actively in **Scrum-based development**, sprint planning, and testing

The project was developed for the **LIPPA project**, in cooperation with product owner Marko ‚ÄúNarsu‚Äù Rintam√§ki and other JAMK support staff.
