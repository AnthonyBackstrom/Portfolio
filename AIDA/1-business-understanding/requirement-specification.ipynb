    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the AI/DA (Artificial Intelligence/Data Analytics) course, TTC8070-3005, offered by JAMK University of Applied Sciences. The assignment involves analyzing a dataset related to used cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project group consists of students from JAMK, collaborating to apply data mining and analytics techniques to gain insights into the used car market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model, which provides a structured framework for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is an \"imaginary customer\" defined for this project, it's important to note that the customer's presence is conceptual. The customer serves as the driving force behind the project's goals and objectives."

    "## Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer is a car dealership chain that has commercial interests in utilizing data analytics for future trading. The chain's core business is currently the sale of brand-independent used vehicles. The customer especially wants to know what features affect the price and sale time of used vehicles. The customer is also interested in what kind of cars (make, type, year model, etc.) can be sold on the market more easily, so that they do not remain in the warehouse for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Area Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Impact on Price: Understand which features (e.g., make, model, mileage, year) significantly affect the pricing of used cars.\n",
    "- Factors Influencing Sale Time: Determine the factors influencing the time a used car stays in inventory before being sold.\n",
    "- Market Demand for Vehicle Types: Identify the types of vehicles and manufacturers that are in higher demand in the market."

    "## Business goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Optimize Pricing Strategy: Determine the features that significantly influence the pricing of used vehicles. The goal is to develop a pricing strategy that maximizes profit while remaining competitive in the market.\n",
    "2. Reduce Inventory Holding Time: Identify factors that impact the sale time of used vehicles. Develop insights to minimize the time cars spend in the dealership's inventory, improving cash flow and operational efficiency.\n",
    "3. Market Demand Understanding: Gain insights into the types of vehicles and manufacturers that have higher demand. This understanding helps in optimizing inventory to meet market preferences, reducing the risk of having unsold vehicles in stock.\n",
    "4. Profitability of selling taxis: The customer was also particularly interested in whether the price of the car been affected if the car has been used by a taxi before. We are going to seek answer to this question also."

    "## Beneficiaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary Beneficiary: The car dealership chain will directly benefit from improved pricing strategies, reduced holding costs, and enhanced market responsiveness.\n",
    "- Secondary Beneficiaries: Customers may benefit from more competitive pricing, and the dealership's partners may benefit from more streamlined inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project costs vs. project benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, while the project may have minimal direct costs due to the voluntary nature of the team, the potential benefits in terms of enhanced profitability, risk reduction, and competitive advantage for the car dealership can be significant. These benefits, when realized, can provide long-term value to the business and outweigh the limited costs involved. Since there is no real customer, we don't get to know the final value of the end result of the project from the customer's point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of the project are more directed to the project team itself, which gets good experience in teamwork and in handling and analyzing large amounts of data and building machine learning models in the team.\n"

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Importance Analysis: We will provide a list of features and their impact on pricing, helping the dealership prioritize influential factors. Ten (10) most dominant charcteristics of best sold cars are presented. The price of cars that used to be taxis is detailed, as well as other characteristics that affect the sale of cars that used to be taxis. Also cars that sell the worst are analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prediction Model for Sale Time: We will develop a model that predicts how long a particular used vehicle is likely to remain in the inventory before being sold. This will help the client to decide if they are going to take the car or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prediction Model for Car Price: We will develop a model that predicts the price for the car as accurately as possible based on the car's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Market Segment Insights: Offer insights into market preferences, helping the dealership make informed decisions about the types of vehicles to stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution offers substantial benefits to the car dealership, empowering them with actionable insights to enhance their operations and profitability. By providing a clear list of the ten most influential characteristics of best-selling cars and detailing pricing trends for former taxi vehicles, our solution equips the dealership with the knowledge to set competitive and profitable prices. This optimization directly leads to increased profit margins and more successful sales. This data-driven approach minimizes guesswork and maximizes the chances of successful sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction model for sale time allows the customer to make informed decisions about whether to acquire a specific used vehicle. This insight is invaluable in reducing the risk of cars sitting in inventory for extended periods. Shorter inventory holding times translate into improved cash flow and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution provides market segment insights, helping the dealership align their inventory with market preferences. By stocking the right types of vehicles preferred by customers, the dealership can boost sales and minimize the risk of having unsold cars in stock. This knowledge also aids in inventory turnover, reducing the financial burden of holding inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of improved inventory management and more competitive pricing, customers may benefit from a broader selection of vehicles, competitive prices, and a smoother buying experience. Satisfied customers are more likely to return and recommend the dealership to others, fostering long-term customer relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution provides the car dealership with a significant competitive advantage in the used car market. By staying ahead of market trends and customer preferences, they can outperform competitors and maintain a strong position in the industry."
