    "## Project Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business understanding and Data understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two steps, we defined the purpose of the project and the need for this project. The customer's needs were mapped in order to understand what the customer really wants so that the application can be developed in the right direction. We also looked into the material so that we could handle it correctly in the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thorough examination of the available data was conducted, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive Data Description Report. This step was essential in determining the cleanliness and adequacy of the data, ensuring its suitability for subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two phases went well and everyone on the team had a clear idea of what the purpose of this project was.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each team member was assigned a topic to research. The topics were \"Impact of Sales Area on Vehicle's Age, Type, and Price\", \"Cars That Sell the Worst\", \"Effect on Price for Vehicles Used as Taxis\" and \"Identifying Dominant Features for Sales\". At this stage, every member of the team gained valuable experience in processing large amounts of data and visualizing that data. At this stage, each team member also got an idea of what information the dataset contains and how we can use the data in the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modeling phase, we tested different models and tried to find out which machine learning model would be the best fit for this data. During this phase, we still had to go back to the preprocessing phase, because in the modeling phase our understanding of the data deepened, and we were able to find out the characteristics that had the most impact on the model. In the modeling phase, we achieved very good results. Optuna parameter optimization was employed to fine-tune the model, ensuring its optimal performance in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. The final model predicts the price of the car with more than 95% accuracy. We are currently satisfied with the accuracy of the model. However, nothing is ever really ready, the model could always be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/results-model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The models were rigorously evaluated to determine which one best aligned with the business objectives. The Model Evaluation process provided insights into the effectiveness of the developed models, allowing for informed decisions on model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The project culminated in the deployment phase, where we got to the point where we run the application locally. The application has a front end and a small back end using the Flask framework. Flask connects the trained model to a user interface where the user enters the car's information and then gets a prediction for the car's price. The information that the user enters in the UI has been selected according to what our machine learning model considers to be the most price-influencing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the entire project, we were able to achieve the so-called MVP. From this, it is easy to continue in the future with a more automated process, where, for example, when new data comes in, the model would be automatically trained with the new data.\n",
