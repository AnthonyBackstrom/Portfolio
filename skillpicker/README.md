# ðŸ“¥ Skillpicker â€“ Future Skills Mapping Tool

**Skillpicker** is a web-based application designed to help bridge the gap between education and industry by collecting future skill needs directly from businesses. The gathered information is forwarded to educational institutions to support course planning and ensure that students are taught the competencies employers actually seek.

This project was developed by **Code Crusaders** during the *Future Factory* course at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, in collaboration with the **LIPPA project**.
